						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of the choosing the right color to create the website.
								Especially, if we would like to increase the revenue for our business through the 
							    website, then we should think it serious because 217 million people are suffering from
							    this problem and this amount of people is not a small number. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was that we should not rely too much on the color because
								we can describe instructions with black sentence and we can avoid the potential errors.
								We always think that less words look cool but it might cause the above potential problems and 
								I had not thought that explaining with words play important role to make website more accessible.

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
