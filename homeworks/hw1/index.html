<p>Hi! My name is Ayumu, and my hobby is exploring outside Berkeley with friends.
     My favorite spot around here is San Francisco because 
    when I go there, I feel like I've come back to my hometown, Tokyo.</p>

    <li>I learned that when people design something, they do not only consider the 
        apperance but also how customer feels and use it. It is important for us to
    think daily about it to improve our design skills. </li>
    <li>My favorite part was the part author mentioned that seeing London excited her on the Search Bar.
        The reason is that I thought they put London as example to make it easier for user to use Search Bar, but 
        it actually added excitement for the planned trip.

    <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll 
        develop your product thinking and get better at 
        designing apps yourself."</li>
    <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it an 8, I enjoyed it a lot!</li>
