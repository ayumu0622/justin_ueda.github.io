					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What I learned from this article is that we shouldn't only consider 
								how cool a design looks, but also think about who we want to convey 
								the information to and which font is easy to read for them. Prior to 
								reading this article, my idea was that if a website design looks as 
								great as Apple's, then it's the best design. However, I realized that 
								the purpose of the design is also really important. For example, 
								Apple's website design for presenting new products is excellent, 
								but if the purpose of the design is not to present a new product, 
								and is more about conveying information through sentences, then 
								that design may not be the best.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was that Pairing Inspiration. 
								I was surprised at the fact that pair of font is as important as fonts themselves. 
								Also, there are so many resources to achieve the better fonts combination and it was unexpected.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Font pairing is just as important as the fonts themselves. </p>
						</li>
