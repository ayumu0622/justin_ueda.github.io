					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the importance of speeds in the design. If it is too fast, user might
								not notice what's happening, but if it is too slow, it might make user feel annoyed.
							    It was really interesting fact because I did not think that 
								engineers care about such a small thing.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was that there were academic research about 
							    the speed of the movement. First, I did not know that academia gets involved with
							    frontend engineering. Second, after seeing the demo of comparing two examples,
							    it made sense so much that I can not notice for 100ms movement, but I can for 250ms
							 </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
