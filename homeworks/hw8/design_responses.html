						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I was thinking that it is okay for companies to deceive the customer to increase the profit but I learned that 
							it was actually not true. However, if you are working as web designer and there is a KPI like sales that you have to achieve to get promoted,
						    most people probably deceive customers somehow to get high KPI. For me, there is hardly boundary
						    between it is ethical or not and a lot of companies set a discount ads which sounds like scam, but they all do so, 
	                        this is a problem that we can not solve simply.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>Most favorite part was friend spam which had been done by Linkedin. I was surprised that 
						   big tech company do not know how to treat personal information at all and I can imagine how it happened easily.
						   In my imagination, a random marketing manager had to achieve the KPI like increasing the number of customers by 5% and 
						   he/she/they thought that using existing customer's information is the best way to find potential customer.
